Atari 800 XL emulator with two implementations in this repository:

- `A8E/`: native C/SDL emulator
- `jsA8E/`: browser JavaScript port (WebGL with CRT post-process, plus 2D canvas fallback)

The original codebase is by Sascha Springer (2004). Each subproject has its own README with detailed usage/build notes.

## Repository Layout

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `A8E/` | [Native C/SDL code and CMake project](A8E/README.md) |
| `jsA8E/` | [Browser app (`index.html` + JavaScript modules + shaders)](jsA8E/README.md) |

## Hardware Reference

For hardware behavior and register-level details, use the local [AHRM index](AHRM/index.md), based on the Altirra Hardware Reference Manual.

## Current Emulation Status

Both emulator cores currently include the following raster-timing behavior:

- Visible scanlines now render playfield/background state on the per-color-clock path.
- Visible player/missile output is interleaved on the scanline timing path in both implementations.
- Visible blank/background-only lines now spend the initial color-burst clocks invisibly before drawing the live-read remainder of the line.
- The VBI follows the AHRM cycle-7 NMIST / cycle-8 NMI model with full NMIEN cycle-7/8 gating, matching the DLI path.
- Vertical scrolling runs on a live 4-bit mode-line row counter with the AHRM VSCROL deadlines (entry latch at cycle 0, exit comparison through cycle 108, DLI decision through cycle 5), enabling GTIA 9++-style extended mode lines and mid-line VSCROL rewrites.
- Mid-scanline CHBASE writes latch with the AHRM 2-color-clock delay in both cores.

PAL and NTSC machine timing, palettes, `$D014`, POKEY behavior, XEX/ATR loading, and the browser WebGL/2D rendering paths are implemented in the corresponding native and browser cores.

The legacy-style per-color-clock rendering pass is implemented in both cores. Remaining work is verification against real raster-effect content (including VSCROL corner cases such as Atomix Plus! and GTIA 9++ demos) and any localized title-specific timing differences found during that sweep.

For the current verification checklist and signoff notes, see [legacy/COLOR_CLOCK_ACCURACY.md](legacy/COLOR_CLOCK_ACCURACY.md).

### Extended Memory

The native and browser implementations support the AHRM memory-map profiles below. The native version selects them on the command line; the browser version exposes them in the Memory selector and through the automation API.

| Profile | Native switch | Browser/API profile |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| 64K | *(default)* | `none` |
| 128K (130XE) | `-128K` | `130xe-128k` |
| 192K (RAMBO) | `-192R` | `rambo-192k` |
| 320K (RAMBO) | `-320R` | `rambo-320k` |
| 320K (COMPY) | `-320C` | `compy-320k` |
| 576K (RAMBO) | `-576R` | `rambo-576k` |
| 576K (COMPY) | `-576C` | `compy-576k` |
| 1088K (RAMBO) | `-1088R` | `rambo-1088k` |
| Ultimate1MB (1MB) | `-U1MB` | `ultimate1mb` *(WIP)* |

RAMBO and COMPY bank-bit layouts, CPU/ANTIC window behavior, BASIC/Self-Test overlays, and bank persistence are implemented and covered by native and browser regression probes. Ultimate1MB currently provides its AHRM memory mapping and core UCTL/UAUX/COLDF control-register behavior, including selectable 64K, 320K, 576K, and 1088K modes. Ultimate1MB BIOS/flash, RTC, PBI devices, and external peripheral images are not yet emulated.

The repository includes two standalone Atari diagnostics for expanded-memory validation: [`U1MB_MEMORY_TEST.XEX`](implementation/U1MB_MEMORY_TEST.XEX) performs full bank, system-window, configuration, and visual ANTIC checks; [`MEMORY_STRESS_TEST.XEX`](implementation/MEMORY_STRESS_TEST.XEX) performs repeated bank-switching and PORTB-map checks. See [implementation/memory_tests.md](implementation/memory_tests.md).

### Regression Tests

The browser regression suite can be run without a browser or ROM files:

```sh
cd jsA8E
npm run test:automation
```

The native CMake project includes probe targets for ANTIC timing, ANTIC DMA and graphics modes, POKEY POT scanning, and memory-expansion behavior. Configure with `-DBUILD_TESTING=ON` to include those targets in the build.

### Compatibility Validation

Several programs that previously failed during loading now reach their normal
startup screens in the emulator:

- **AtariBlast** completes its mixed-geometry ATR load and reaches the game screen.
- **Amaurote Plus** starts from XEX and reaches its game menu after the
  presentation; see [the investigation](ATR/amaurote.md).
- **Mikie V1.12** completes its banked XEX load and reaches the control screen.
- **AtariWriter Plus XE** completes its 130XE startup sequence and reaches the user menu.
- **Karate Champion** and **Animal Party** are also covered by the generic DLI/NMI
  and SIO compatibility work; their full title-specific startup validation remains in progress.

These results come from generic fixes to XEX RUNAD handling, memory-bank/window
behavior, IRQ state, and XL/XE hardware defaults; no title-specific workarounds
are used.

## ROM Requirements

Both implementations require the following ROM dumps (not included):

- `ATARIXL.ROM` (16 KB)
- `ATARIBAS.ROM` (8 KB)

Recommended placement is the repository root:

- Native app loads ROM files from its current working directory.
- Browser app can load ROMs via UI file inputs, and also attempts `../ATARIXL.ROM` + `../ATARIBAS.ROM` when served from repo root.

## Quick Start (Browser)

Serve the repository root with a static HTTP server, then open `jsA8E/`.

```sh
python -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/jsA8E/
```

(`file://` is not sufficient because shader and ROM auto-load paths use `fetch()`.)

When the browser emulator starts with D1 empty, it mounts the built-in
`standby.xex` and shows disk-loading instructions through an ANTIC display
list. **Open Disk** loads and starts a selected image. Disk Library mount
changes take effect without restarting the running program, so it can request
another disk side; the library status only confirms the mount action. Use
**Full Reset** when you want to boot from the image currently mounted in D1.
See the [browser README](jsA8E/README.md) for more details.

## Automation

The browser port includes a stable automation surface at `window.A8EAutomation`.

It is intended to be the canonical shared control surface for debugger/introspection workflows, artifact capture, HostFS access, assembler-driven development flows, and higher-level harnesses. The public surface is grouped into `system`, `media`, `input`, `debug`, `dev`, `artifacts`, and `events` while keeping the earlier flat aliases for compatibility.

Current highlights include worker-acknowledged lifecycle control, URL-native ROM/disk/XEX loading, structured pause/fault events, schema-versioned failure artifacts, HostFS file automation, assembler/XEX helpers, and versioned full-machine snapshot save/load through `system.saveSnapshot()` / `system.loadSnapshot()`. The repository also includes a browser-less Node bootstrap at `jsA8E/headless.js` that instantiates the same automation API against the no-worker backend.

For external agents, CI jobs, scripted regression runs, and other non-interactive control flows, prefer the browser-less bootstrap over driving the browser UI directly. It avoids DOM/worker/UI state, starts with an attached API immediately, and exposes the same grouped automation contract. For Codex-style MCP clients, `jsA8E/mcp_server.js` provides a local stdio bridge over the same runtime and grouped tool surface. See the [jsA8E README](jsA8E/README.md) for the overview and [jsA8E/AUTOMATION.md](jsA8E/AUTOMATION.md) for the full public API reference.

## Quick Start (Native)

Building requires **SDL 2** development headers. See the [A8E README](A8E/README.md) for full build instructions covering Windows (MSVC, MinGW), macOS (Homebrew), and Linux.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
./build/A8E/A8E
```

Ensure `ATARIXL.ROM` and `ATARIBAS.ROM` are in the current working directory before starting.

## Controls

Both implementations share the same key mappings.

### Keyboard

Type normally on the emulated Atari keyboard. **Ctrl** and **Shift** work as modifiers, matching the original Atari 800 XL layout.

### Joystick

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| Arrow Keys | Joystick direction |
| **Shift** + Arrow Keys | Atari cursor keys (↑ ↓ ← →) |
| Left Alt | Fire button |

Shift + Arrow is a convenience shortcut — it sends the same key codes as **Ctrl + − / = / + / \*** on the Atari keyboard (the original cursor controls).

### Console Keys

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| F2 | OPTION |
| F3 | SELECT |
| F4 | START |
| F5 | RESET |
| F8 | BREAK |
