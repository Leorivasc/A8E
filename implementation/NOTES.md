> Hardware emulation reference: Before implementing any Atari 800 XL PAL machine related hardware emulation, use the [AHRM](/AHRM/index.md) as reference.

Simple implementation notes for this repository.

- 2026-09-10: `A8E/6502.c`: matched the validated jsA8E NMI dispatch fix. Native A8E now accepts one pending NMI edge while an earlier NMI handler is active, instead of dropping it behind the software active-handler guard. The single pending flag is retained to avoid queueing unbounded interrupts.
- 2026-09-11: `A8E/Pokey.c`: synchronized disk READ responses with jsA8E by delivering the command ACK separately from the Complete/data/checksum phase. The pending phase is queued when the ACK is consumed, matching AHRM SIO framing without changing write, status, format, or poll commands.

Reference: follow `AGENTS.md`.
Process rule: review this file before planning any improvement, and update it after each code improvement.

Maintenance rule: temporary diagnostics and single-purpose test routines must be removed after the related bug is confirmed, unless they are generalized into reusable regression tests. Avoid accumulating one-off test hooks in the emulator.

Keep reusable inspection points: the public `A8EAutomation` connection and general-purpose memory, CPU, state, trace, disassembly, breakpoint, and input controls may remain available for future investigations. Remove only game-specific wrappers, probes, counters, and cache-busters once their investigation is complete.

- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/js/core/{state,pokey_sio,atari,app_proxy}.js`, `jsA8E/emulator_worker.js`: added a bounded, non-invasive SIO event trace to identify disk-loader stalls. It records command/sector requests, queued responses, and SERIN reads without changing SIO timing or data behavior; remove it after the investigation unless generalized for future diagnostics.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/tests/cdp_diagnostic.js`: extended the temporary Animal Party SIO capture to include loader variables, POKEY serial registers, and disassembly in the same run, avoiding unreliable post-reload inspection.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/tests/cdp_diagnostic.js`: included the NMI/IRQ vectors and handler disassembly in the Animal Party capture to identify the source of the loader's `$A527` wait flag.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/tests/cdp_diagnostic.js`: reduced the Animal Party capture output to the final SIO events while retaining the full CPU/vector diagnostics.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/tests/cdp_diagnostic.js`: compacted disassembly in the Animal Party capture so the NMI/IRQ handler flow remains visible without truncating the result.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/tests/cdp_diagnostic.js`: added timed post-button samples of the Animal Party loader flag and POKEY status to distinguish a transient load phase from a stable wait loop.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/tests/cdp_diagnostic.js`: added an optional pre-button screenshot mode so the automated test can verify it reaches the presentation screen before sending joystick input.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/tests/cdp_diagnostic.js`: made pre-button screenshot mode wait 30 seconds; the earlier 12-second capture was still a black loading state and could not validate the intended button transition.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/tests/cdp_diagnostic.js`: corrected the button-phase capture to use Worker-backed state and include post-button SIO events; the prior reproduction now confirms the presentation wait state at `$9088` and a return to the boot loop after the pulse.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/tests/cdp_diagnostic.js`: compacted button-phase samples to avoid duplicating full SIO state in every timed CPU sample.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/tests/cdp_diagnostic.js`: added a memory window around `$8180` to compare the post-button sector-126 load with the ATR payload.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/tests/cdp_diagnostic.js`: added a compact pre-buffer capture for the Animal Party DCB and candidate load windows, without changing machine state.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/tests/cdp_diagnostic.js`: corrected the candidate load window from `$8180` to `$8100`, matching the DCB buffer low/high bytes (`$8101`).
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/tests/cdp_diagnostic.js`: added the actual post-button DCB buffer (`$0881`) to the temporary Animal Party inspection, after decoding the DCB fields correctly; this remains diagnostic-only.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/tests/cdp_diagnostic.js`: extended the post-button capture with `$0881` and `$02FC`, the buffer and completion flag used by the ATR boot loader.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/js/core/{state,memory,io,pokey_sio}.js`: separated disk READ responses into the Acknowledgment and Complete/data phases described by AHRM SIO, preserving the pending phase through snapshots; this is the first Animal Party compatibility experiment and remains under verification.
- 2026-09-10: `A8E/Pokey.c`, `jsA8E/js/core/pokey_sio.js`: added generic AHRM handling for disk `$3F` high-speed index queries and silent routing for absent Type 1/3/4 peripherals. Disk IDs use the high-speed query; non-disk devices do not receive fabricated responses.

## Recent Improvements

- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/js/core/{state,cpu,antic,atari,app_proxy}.js`, `jsA8E/js/app/automation/utils.js`, `jsA8E/emulator_worker.js`: added non-invasive DLI/VBI/NMI timing diagnostics to `getDebugState()` and preserved them across the Worker boundary. The counters distinguish scheduled, latched, suppressed, requested, coalesced, and serviced NMIs, including the last event location, coalesced source classification, CPU pending/active state, and RTI/RTS return counts; emulation behavior is unchanged and the counters reset with the machine. A temporary Worker URL cache-buster is marked in `app_proxy.js` for live Chrome diagnostics.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/js/core/cpu.js`, `jsA8E/tests/cpu_interrupt_step_regression.test.js`: removed the software `nmiActive` mask from pending-NMI dispatch. A new edge can now be serviced while an earlier NMI handler is active, while the single pending flag still prevents an unbounded queue; this follows the 6502 NMI behavior and targets the DLI coalescing observed with Karate Champion.

- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/js/core/{atari,state,antic,memory}.js`, `jsA8E/js/{core/app_proxy,app/automation/utils}.js`: extended `getDebugState()` with non-invasive POKEY timer-4 diagnostics (`IRQEN`, `IRQST`, timer configuration, deadline, IRQ count, and CPU IRQ state) to investigate Bosconian's digitized-voice wait loop. The field is now preserved across the worker/API boundary, the diagnostic counter is preserved in snapshots, and neither changes emulation behavior.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/js/core/{pokey,io,atari}.js`: arm inactive POKEY timers when valid AUDF/AUDCTL or SKCTL configuration arrives after an earlier STIMER, without resetting already-running timer phase. This covers software that configures a timer after initialization and is based on AHRM POKEY initialization behavior.
- 2026-09-10: `A8E/Pokey.c`: ported the inactive POKEY timer arming behavior to the native core. AUDF/AUDCTL/SKCTL writes now schedule a valid timer that previously had no deadline without disturbing active timer phase; the implementation is independent of memory expansion.
- 2026-09-10: `A8E/{A8E.c,AtariIo.c,AtariIo.h,Pia.c}`, `A8E/README.md`: added the first native memory-expansion profile, 130XE 128K, selectable with `-128K`. PORTB selects the four 16K banks and separate CPU/ANTIC window enables; ANTIC playfield, virtual-bus, and PMG reads honor the extended window. Larger RAMBO/COMPY profiles remain unimplemented.
- 2026-09-10: `A8E/{AtariIo.h,AtariIo.c,Pia.c}`: preserved a shadow copy of the main `$4000-$7FFF` window while the 130XE CPU window is enabled, restoring it when the window is disabled. This is required by Bosconian's bank-isolation test and prevents extended-bank writes from corrupting the visible main-memory copy.
- 2026-09-10: `A8E/A8E.c`, `A8E/README.md`: added a startup log reporting the selected native memory profile, matching the existing audio startup diagnostics.
- 2026-09-10: validated native `-128K` with `Bosconian.atr`; Bosconian now detects the 130XE memory, loads successfully, and its digitized-voice audio works with the native POKEY timer fix. RAMBO and COMPY profiles remain pending.

- 2026-08-03: real-content spot verification of the timing changes below via the headless runtime with real XL OS/BASIC ROMs: cold boot reaches the BASIC READY prompt with byte-exact screen contents, the SELF TEST menu renders correctly, and `d1.atr` (DOS 2.x boot + Schränker 3 with its DLI color-ladder title screen) loads and renders cleanly. The full disk-content regression sweep from `legacy/COLOR_CLOCK_ACCURACY.md` remains open.

- 2026-08-03: `A8E/AtariIo.{c,h}`, `jsA8E/js/core/{antic,state,memory}.js`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/{renderer_base,mode_2_3,mode_4_5,mode_6_7}.js`, `A8E/tests/antic_timing_probe.c`, `jsA8E/tests/antic_vscrol_timing.test.js`: replaced the fetch-time VSCROL height clamps with a live 4-bit mode-line row counter per AHRM 4.7 in both cores. Region entries latch VSCROL at the mode-line fetch and wrap out-of-range values (GTIA 9++ extended lines now work); region-exit lines end when the counter matches the live VSCROL value latched at the top of the cycle-109 clock action (writes through cycle 108 count), so mid-mode-line VSCROL rewrites shorten, extend, or wrap the line. Exit-line DLIs are armed dynamically at cycle 6 of the scanline whose counter matches VSCROL as of cycle 5 (AHRM 4.8), letting the DLI and height decisions diverge as in the documented turbo double-write trick. Character renderers now derive glyph rows from the row counter with the AHRM tall-line mappings (modes 2/3 rows 10-15 repeat 2-7 and rows 8-9 blank/descend, modes 4/6 repeat rows 0-7, modes 5/7 halve the scanline counter); the old `verticalScrollOffset` plumbing was removed. JS snapshots persist the new row-counter state and tolerate older payloads.

- 2026-08-03: `A8E/{Antic.c,AtariIo.c,AtariIo.h,6502.c,6502.h}`, `A8E/tests/antic_graphics_modes_probe.c`: ported the jsA8E delayed CHBASE latch to the C core per AHRM 4.4. `Antic_CHBASE` schedules the new value 2 color clocks after the bus write (offset by instruction length minus one via the new `cCurrentInstructionCycles` context field), and character modes 2-7 poll `AtariIo_CurrentChbaseRegister` every render cycle instead of snapshotting CHBASE before the loop, so mid-scanline DLI character-set switches land at the correct beam position in both cores.

- 2026-08-03: `A8E/{Antic.c,AtariIo.c,AtariIo.h}`, `jsA8E/js/core/{antic,state,memory}.js`, `A8E/tests/antic_timing_probe.c`, `jsA8E/tests/antic_display_list_nmi.test.js`: aligned VBI timing with AHRM 4.8 in both cores. The VBI now uses the same two-phase model as the DLI: NMIST VBI latches at cycle 7 of scan line 248 (clearing the DLI status bit), the NMI fires at cycle 8, and the NMIEN cycle-7/8 gating (one-cycle delay for a cycle-7 enable, cycle-8 disable suppression) applies. Previously the VBI fired unconditionally at the 247/248 line boundary. JS snapshots persist the armed `vbiCycle` deadline.

- 2026-06-01: `A8E/tests/antic_graphics_modes_probe.c`: restored the probe's SDL-compatible `main(int argc, char *argv[])` signature so the MinGW/SDL2main build no longer conflicts with SDL's `SDL_main` declaration.

- 2026-05-20: `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/mode_8_f.js`, `jsA8E/tests/playfield_mode_8_f_rendering.test.js`: corrected JS ANTIC mode A bitmap expansion to consume all four two-bit pairs in each byte. Mode 8 still repeats each pair across two output cycles, but mode A now advances per pair, fixing the broken Archon board-border bitmap line.

- 2026-05-20: `jsA8E/js/core/hw.js`, `A8E/AtariIo.c`, `jsA8E/tests/playfield_geometry_timing.test.js`: merged the viewport-centering change with the corrected AHRM GTIA origin. The normal 320-pixel playfield starts at full-line `x=96`, so the 336-pixel visible crop starts at `x=88` and keeps the playfield at screen `x=8..327`.

- 2026-05-12: `A8E/AtariIo.c`, `A8E/tests/antic_graphics_modes_probe.c`, `jsA8E/js/core/{gtia,playfield/{playfield,renderer_base}}.js`, `jsA8E/tests/{playfield_geometry_timing,playfield_hscroll_priority_preservation,gtia_pmg_dma_regression}.test.js`: corrected the GTIA/playfield horizontal origin. Normal-width playfield now starts at GTIA color clock `$30` (`x=96` in the 456-pixel line buffer) instead of the previous shifted `x=104`, which centers character modes in the 336-pixel viewport. PMG `HPOS=$30` now maps to the same `x=96` coordinate. Native probes now verify modes 2-7 start at the corrected origin.

- 2026-05-12: `A8E/AtariIo.c`, `A8E/tests/antic_graphics_modes_probe.c`, `A8E/tests/{antic_timing_probe,antic_dma_probe}.c`, `jsA8E/js/core/{atari,playfield/mode_2_3}.js`, `jsA8E/tests/playfield_mode_2_3_rendering.test.js`: tightened ANTIC character-mode rendering against AHRM 4.4/4.11/4.14. Modes 2/3 now treat CHACTL blank+invert as an inverted zero glyph in both cores; JS blanking no longer depends on the character-0 font contents. Native mode 5 now uses the required 1K CHBASE alignment, and native modes 5/7 fetch character data on every repeated scanline instead of silently skipping odd doubled rows. Added a native graphics-mode probe for these regressions and refreshed native DLI probe constants to the current NMIST-cycle representation.

- 2026-04-14: `jsA8E/js/core/{cpu,io}.js`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/renderer_base.js`: corrected CHBASE delayed-latch origin per AHRM 4.4. The 2-color-clock latch delay must be measured from the bus write cycle (last cycle of the instruction), not from the instruction start. Since `executeOne` runs instructions atomically, the IO handler now offsets by `(ctx.currentInstructionCycles − 1)` to place the write at the correct point. For STA absolute (4 cycles), the effective latch is now at `io.clock + 5` instead of `io.clock + 2`, fixing a 3-cycle-early CHBASE effect that caused DLI-driven character set switches (e.g. Archon 2 attract mode) to show fewer garbled characters than real hardware.

- 2026-04-13: `A8E/AtariIo.c`, `jsA8E/js/core/antic.js`, `jsA8E/tests/antic_display_list_nmi.test.js`: aligned DLI NMIST/NMI timing with AHRM 4.8 in both cores. `DLI_HORIZONTAL_OFFSET` changed from 8 to 7 (the NMIST cycle); the event handler now sets NMIST at cycle 7 unconditionally and fires the NMI at cycle 8. The `enabledOnCycle7Mask` delay path now reschedules to `beamCycle` (not `beamCycle+1`) so the delayed NMI fires one cycle later at cycle 9. Tests updated to exercise the two-phase cycle-7/cycle-8 behavior explicitly.

- 2026-04-09: `A8E/AtariIo.c`, `jsA8E/js/core/gtia.js`, `jsA8E/tests/gtia_pmg_dma_regression.test.js`: aligned PM horizontal origin with the then-current playfield coordinate map. This was superseded on 2026-05-12 by the corrected GTIA color-clock origin (`HPOS $30 -> x=96`). The interleaved PMG renderer in both cores continues to use the per-line shift-register/state-machine model.

- 2026-04-08: `A8E/AtariIo.c`, `A8E/AtariIo.h`, `jsA8E/js/core/{gtia,antic,memory,state}.js`, `jsA8E/tests/gtia_pmg_dma_regression.test.js`: replaced the interleaved PMG line latch with a bounded per-line trigger queue in both cores. Active PM objects keep their original horizontal start through mid-image `HPOS` writes, `HPOS=0` renders correctly, and repeated rightward same-line retriggers can now build overlapping duplicate images again (matching `dbug.atr` style logo assembly more closely). JS snapshots now preserve the PMG queue state.

- 2026-04-08: `A8E/AtariIo.c`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/{mode_4_5,mode_6_7}.js`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/renderer_base.js`: fixed character-mode CHACTL/CHBASE timing in both cores. In JS, CHACTL is now latched once at scanline start in modes 4/5/6/7 (matching existing mode 2/3 behavior), and the CHBASE delayed-latch window corrected from +1 to +2 cycles per AHRM 4.4. In C, CHBASE and CHACTL are now snapshotted before the render loop in all modes 2–7, eliminating mid-scanline DLI drift. C modes 2/3 now also correctly implement CHACTL bit 0 (blank), bit 1 (invert), and bit 2 (vertical reflection), which were previously unimplemented; bit 2 reflection is now applied in all C modes 4–7 as well.

- 2026-04-05: `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/renderer_base.js`, `jsA8E/tests/playfield_dma_contention_regression.test.js`: tightened the JS ANTIC virtual-bus path per AHRM 4.14. Late playfield fetches after cycle 105 now honor the active CPU bus address even when it is `$0000` (fixed JavaScript truthiness bug), while the deferred-refresh overlap case remains pinned to pulled-up `$FF`.

- 2026-04-03: `jsA8E/js/core/{antic,io,memory,state}.js`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/{renderer_base,mode_8_f}.js`: simplified JS emulation core state flow. `state.js` now owns the fixed `ioData` shape (including `nmiTiming`, `chbaseTiming`, per-line DMA buffers); ANTIC and the playfield renderer no longer rebuild these lazily in hot paths. Media helpers normalize a single shared `machine.media` object instead of patching nested fields in place.

- 2026-04-03: `A8E/{AtariIo.h,Pokey.c}`, `jsA8E/js/core/{atari,io,memory,pokey,state}.js`: aligned POKEY pot-scan model with AHRM. Slow scans advance once per scanline; fast scans advance per machine cycle and hold the `229` terminal count for one extra cycle before forcing `ALLPOT` low; scans run through terminal hold even when `ALLPOT` has already cleared; `SKCTL` mode changes resync from current cycle. JS snapshots preserve mid-scan counter state.

- 2026-04-03: `A8E/{Antic.c,AtariIo.c}`, `jsA8E/js/core/{antic,io,memory,state}.js`: aligned same-scanline DLI `NMIEN` timing with AHRM 4.8 in both cores. Writes by cycle 7 enable the current-line DLI (with one-beam-cycle delay); writes on cycle 8 can still suppress it; NMIST latches unconditionally. JS snapshot state extended to preserve the ANTIC timing latch.

- 2026-03-31: `A8E/AtariIo.{c,h}`, `jsA8E/js/core/{state,memory,antic}.js`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/{renderer_base,mode_2_3,mode_4_5,mode_6_7,mode_8_f}.js`: completed ANTIC heavy-contention DMA pass in both cores. Playfield DMA scheduled per line cycle (not bulk stall); first-row fetches fill a reusable 48-byte line buffer; character modes 2–7 place character-data fetch in the later `+3` cycle slot; late fetches after cycle 105 use the virtual CPU bus / refresh-drop path.

- 2026-03-31: `A8E/AtariIo.c`, `jsA8E/js/core/antic.js`: corrected ANTIC NMI timing in both cores. DLI asserts at cycle 8 of the triggering scanline per AHRM 4.8; VBI asserts at the start of scan line 248. VCOUNT flips to the next scanline on cycle 111 of the previous line per AHRM 4.10, including the one-cycle PAL end-of-frame anomaly. Active-line playfield geometry corrected to AHRM 4.14 width starts.

- 2026-03-26: `A8E/6502.c`, `jsA8E/js/core/cpu.js`: aligned undocumented opcodes with the fake6502/Lorenz reference suite in both cores. Covers `ANE`, `LXA`, `ARR`, `LAS`, `SHA`, `SHX`, `SHY`, `TAS`, `RRA`, `SBX`, including the `SHX`/`SHY` write-address glitch and `RRA`/`ISC` decimal-cycle cancellation.

- 2026-03-26: `jsA8E/mcp_server.js`, `jsA8E/tests/mcp_server.test.js`, `jsA8E/package.json`, `README.md`, `jsA8E/README.md`, `jsA8E/AUTOMATION.md`, `implementation/jsA8E/AUTOMATION.md`, `implementation/NOTES.md`: added a local stdio MCP bridge over the headless jsA8E automation runtime for Codex-style clients. The server now exposes `get_capabilities`, `get_system_state`, and `call_automation` with grouped `domain`/`action` routing, keeps binary payloads on base64 or file-path boundaries, and returns screenshot image content plus structured base64 data.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/core/{atari.js,atari_snapshot.js}`, `jsA8E/index.html`, `jsA8E/headless.js`, `jsA8E/emulator_worker.js`, `jsA8E/tests/snapshot_save_timing.test.js`: split the snapshot encode/decode and restore cluster out of `atari.js` into a dedicated runtime module. `atari.js` now keeps thin config helpers plus public wrappers, while `A8EAtariSnapshot` owns snapshot building, save/load, screenshot capture, and artifact collection.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/app/automation/{build,xex,automation_api}.js`, `jsA8E/index.html`, `jsA8E/headless.js`, `jsA8E/tests/automation_{memory_helpers,snapshot_api,system_state_resilience,url_media_loading,xex_boot_failure}.test.js`: split the build/source-context/disassembly helper cluster out of `automation_api.js` into a dedicated support module. Assembly now owns the last-build record and source lookup/disassembly helpers behind `A8EAutomationBuild`, while `automation_api.js` keeps only thin API wrappers and the boot/load harnesses load `build.js` before the facade.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/app/automation/{xex,automation_api}.js`, `jsA8E/index.html`, `jsA8E/headless.js`, `jsA8E/tests/automation_{memory_helpers,snapshot_api,system_state_resilience,url_media_loading,xex_boot_failure}.test.js`: split the XEX boot/orchestration helper cluster out of `automation_api.js` into a dedicated support module. `runXex` now delegates to the new helper layer, and the boot/load harnesses load `xex.js` before `automation_api.js` so the public API can stay thin.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/app/automation/{media,artifacts,automation_api}.js`, `jsA8E/index.html`, `jsA8E/headless.js`, `jsA8E/tests/automation_{memory_helpers,snapshot_api,system_state_resilience,url_media_loading,xex_boot_failure}.test.js`: split the media/resource-loading helper cluster out of `automation_api.js` into a dedicated support module. URL fetch, ROM/disk request normalization, HostFS include resolution, assembler option building, and URL-backed media loaders now live behind the new helper layer, while `automation_api.js` keeps only the thin public wrappers.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/app/automation/{artifacts,automation_api}.js`, `jsA8E/index.html`, `jsA8E/headless.js`, `jsA8E/tests/automation_{memory_helpers,snapshot_api,system_state_resilience,url_media_loading,xex_boot_failure}.test.js`: split the artifact/failure snapshot cluster out of `automation_api.js` into a dedicated helper module. The public API still exposes the same methods, but wait failure snapshots, artifact bundles, and XEX boot failure capture now delegate through thin wrappers backed by the new support file, and every boot path/test harness loads that support file before `automation_api.js`.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/core/{atari.js,atari_support.js}`, `jsA8E/index.html`, `jsA8E/emulator_worker.js`, `jsA8E/headless.js`: split the snapshot/video/artifact helper cluster out of `atari.js` into a shared support module. `atari.js` now keeps boot/runtime orchestration, while the new helper file owns reusable video cloning/restoration, frame-alignment, artifact range normalization, and screenshot capture logic.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/mode_8_f.js`: reduced the repeated ANTIC 8/F scanline write blocks by introducing small pair/quad write helpers and a shared mode 8/A body. The helper cuts keep the hot-path structure explicit while removing the largest duplicated pixel-write fragments in the file.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/mode_2_3.js`: reduced the duplicated ANTIC mode 2/3 text scanline bodies with a shared helper that takes the character-row fetch function and scroll base as parameters. The wrappers are now thin mode selectors, which keeps the mode-specific differences obvious while removing repeated pixel-write code.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/mode_{4_5,6_7}.js`: reduced duplicated text-mode scanline bodies by introducing per-file common render helpers for the paired ANTIC modes. The wrappers now only select the fetch function and scroll/DMA variant, which makes the inner loops easier to follow without changing behavior.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/app/automation/{utils,automation_api}.js`: split out shared automation helpers for XEX launch, failure normalization, timeout parsing, and state cloning. `automation_api.js` now keeps orchestration only, while `utils.js` owns the reusable helper layer, including the preflight range clone used by XEX snapshots.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/core/gtia.js`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/mode_8_f.js`, `implementation/NOTES.md`: small runtime cleanup pass. Removed the unused `vdelayMask` parameter from the GTIA PMG DMA address helper and hoisted the mode-F M10 priority lookup table out of the inner scanline loop to reduce per-cycle allocation churn.

- 2026-03-19: `jsA8E/js/core/gtia.js`, `A8E/AtariIo.c`: fixed PMG DMA timing in both cores. `VDELAY` now masks per-sprite DMA fetches on even scan lines instead of shifting PMG memory rows; player DMA keeps the missile slot active as required by AHRM 4.13. Native C now uses a unified cycle-accurate `AtariIo_FetchPmgDmaCycle` scheduled in `AtariIo_DrawClockAction` at the documented DMA cycle slots.

- 2026-03-19: `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/playfield.js`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/renderer_base.js`, `A8E/AtariIo.c`: fixed HSCROL clip/background fill paths to preserve already-composited PMG pixels in both the clipped aperture fill and trailing border area.

- 2026-03-19: `jsA8E/js/core/{gtia,antic,atari}.js`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/`, `jsA8E/js/core/state.js`: code quality review pass. Fixed GTIA priority mask truncation (`& 0xffff`), wired `PRIO_PF3`/`PRIO_M10_PM0-3` through the full config chain, corrected VCOUNT update ordering in `clockAction()`, removed dead code throughout.

- 2026-08-16: `jsA8E/{index.html,style.css,js/app/ui.js,js/core/{hw,atari,app_proxy}.js,emulator_worker.js}`: wired a minimal PAL/NTSC selector into the browser UI and boot path. The selected standard now persists through `window.A8E_BOOT_OPTIONS` / `localStorage`, reaches both the main-thread and worker backends before hardware setup, and rebuilds the timing tables on reload. `hw.js` now selects PAL vs NTSC line count and CPU clock from the boot standard, and `$D014` reads back `01` for PAL / `0F` for NTSC per AHRM so `peek(53268)` can distinguish the machine type again.


- 2026-08-17: `jsA8E/{index.html,style.css,js/app/ui.js,js/core/{state,io,memory,atari,app_proxy}.js,emulator_worker.js}`: reworked the browser memory-expansion path on top of the clean PAL/NTSC base. The UI now exposes a profile selector, `PORTB` writes preserve the raw banking bits, and the runtime carries the active extended-RAM profile through main-thread and worker boot/reset flows while restoring the banked window on `PORTB` changes. Snapshot state now includes the memory profile so COMPY and larger RAMBO variants can keep CPU/ANTIC views separate.

- 2026-08-17: project checkpoint.
  - Confirmed: PAL/NTSC selector is wired through the browser boot path.
  - Confirmed: `peek(53268)` distinguishes PAL and NTSC again.
  - Confirmed: PAL and NTSC now use separate browser palette tables.
  - Confirmed: the BASIC color-bar test shows a visible PAL/NTSC difference.
  - Pending: memory-expansion compatibility still needs a clean verification pass.


- 2026-08-17: `jsA8E/{js/render/{palette,software}.js,js/core/atari.js}`: split the browser color palette by video standard so NTSC and PAL no longer share a single RGB table. The renderer now passes `videoStandard` into palette construction, giving NTSC its own chroma tuning path and leaving PAL with a separate mapping.
- 2026-08-17: `jsA8E/{js/render/{palette,software}.js,js/core/atari.js}`: restored the PAL palette to the original C hue table and switched NTSC to a separate, more evenly spaced hue progression. The browser renderer still selects the palette from `videoStandard`, so PAL keeps its prior look while NTSC can diverge more realistically.
- 2026-08-17: `jsA8E/js/render/palette.js`: documented the calibrated palette split for future reference. PAL keeps the legacy C hue table (`0, 163, 150, 109, 42, 17, -3, -14, -26, -53, -80, -107, -134, -161, -188, -197`), while NTSC uses the smoother progression (`0, 163, 139, 115, 91, 67, 43, 19, -5, -29, -53, -77, -101, -125, -149, -173`). This was verified visually with the BASIC color-bar test, which now shows a clear PAL/NTSC difference without collapsing the PAL palette.

- 2026-09-08: `A8E/{A8E.c,AtariIo.{c,h},Gtia.c,Pokey.c}`: ported the PAL/NTSC machine selection to the native C emulator. PAL remains the default; `-n` selects NTSC with 262 lines, 1.789773 MHz POKEY timing, `$D014 = $0F`, a separate NTSC palette, and an NTSC logical pixel aspect. The internal 456-pixel line and maximum 312-line allocation remain shared only as storage limits; active timing and register behavior use the selected machine state.

- 2026-09-09: `A8E/A8E.c`: replaced the fixed 18 ms no-audio fallback delay with the selected machine's rounded frame period. This prevents NTSC (about 16.68 ms per frame) from being throttled below its native cadence while preserving PAL's approximately 20 ms cadence.
- 2026-09-09: `A8E/Pokey.c`: added startup diagnostics for SDL audio initialization, device opening, and negotiated format. Audio failures previously fell back to silent operation without reporting the cause.
- 2026-09-09: `A8E/{A8E.c,Pokey.{c,h},AtariIo.c,AtariIo.h}`: added `-d` audio diagnostics. The native emulator writes per-frame CSV metrics for ring level, generated/consumed samples, underruns, overruns, selected standard, and SDL audio status.
- 2026-09-09: `A8E/A8E.c`: audio playback now uses the SDL ring buffer as the sole active timing source. The PAL/NTSC frame-delay fallback is used only when SDL audio is not playing, preventing the extra delay from causing audio underruns.
- 2026-09-09: `A8E/Pokey.c`: on Windows only, failed default SDL audio opening now retries with `SDL_AudioInit("directsound")`; Linux and macOS retain SDL's automatic backend selection. Startup logs now include the active SDL audio driver.
- 2026-09-09: `A8E/Pokey.c`: accepted SDL devices negotiating mono or stereo output. The native POKEY mixer remains mono and duplicates each frame into both channels for stereo devices, avoiding a false initialization failure when Windows defaults to two channels.
- 2026-09-09: `A8E/Pokey.c`: accepted SDL devices negotiating 32-bit signed or float output in addition to `AUDIO_S16SYS`. In particular, `0x8120` is `AUDIO_F32SYS`; the callback converts the 16-bit POKEY mixer output to float or signed 32-bit samples and preserves mono/stereo handling.
- 2026-09-09: `A8E/Pokey.c`: corrected the SDL callback branch selection so `AUDIO_F32SYS` uses the 32-bit conversion path instead of being written as 16-bit PCM. This fixes silent output when the Windows WASAPI device negotiates format `0x8120`.
- 2026-08-21: `Memory` branch: restored the PAL/NTSC palette selection lost during the merge from `main`. The memory-expansion changes remain untouched; the software renderer now receives the hardware video standard and selects the matching PAL or NTSC hue table.

- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/js/core/pokey_sio.js`, `jsA8E/js/core/pokey.js`: made the absent-device path explicitly clear pending `SERIN` data, the pending read phase, and the SERIN-ready flag before allowing `$3F/$40` polls to time out. This preserves the no-response behavior while preventing stale bytes from a previous SIO command from being consumed as a poll result.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/js/core/pokey_sio.js`: corrected the timeout cleanup to use the configured `CYCLE_NEVER` sentinel. The missing local constant caused the CPU execution error that appeared as the blue-screen hang after the first timeout patch.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/js/core/atari.js`: completed the SIO timeout wiring by passing the active frame-cycle value into POKEY/SIO. Without this connection, absent-device timeouts were scheduled with `NaN` and `TIMFLG` could never be raised.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/js/core/{pokey_sio,antic}.js`: corrected `TIMFLG` polarity using the OS definition: SIO waits start with `$0317=1`, and an absent-device timeout changes it to `$00`. The previous diagnostic implementation inverted this flag.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/js/core/antic.js`: completed the generic absent-SIO-device timeout cleanup. When `TIMFLG` expires, pending serial timing events, frame phases, response bytes, and active-low serial IRQ sources are cleared without changing the OS DCB or inventing a peripheral response.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/js/core/{atari,pokey,pokey_sio}.js`: aligned the synthetic absent-device `DTIMLO` timeout to the next OS VBI (scan line 248) instead of expiring at an arbitrary SIO command cycle. The selected PAL/NTSC frame geometry is passed into SIO so the timing remains standard-specific.
- 2026-09-10: `jsA8E/js/core/pokey_sio.js`: stopped rearming the absent-device `DTIMLO` timeout on every Type 1 poll retry. The first unanswered `$3F` command starts one timeout window; subsequent retries remain silent until that same window expires.
- 2026-09-11: `jsA8E/js/core/pokey_sio.js`: cleared all three active-low serial IRQST sources (`$08/$10/$20`) before an absent-device poll retry. Clearing only SERIN could leave stale SEROUT/ transmission-done state from the preceding disk command and alter the OS SIOV retry path.
- 2026-09-11: `jsA8E/js/core/pokey_sio.js`: made absent `$3F/$40` SIO devices fully silent by removing the artificial `IRQST`, `TIMFLG`, SERIN and SEROUT cleanup. The OS now exclusively owns the timeout/retry result, per AHRM 9.1.
- 2026-09-11: `jsA8E/{js/core/app_proxy.js,emulator_worker.js}`: versioned the worker and `pokey_sio.js` URLs as `sio-silent1` so the absent-device behavior change cannot be hidden by browser cache.
- 2026-09-11: removed AtariWriter-only reset/checksum/status probes, CDP wrappers, cache-busters, and placeholder 850/R: device classes after that investigation was paused. Generic SIO disk phases, absent-device routing, bounded SIO events, and reusable public inspection APIs remain.
