## Recent Improvements

- 2026-08-03: real-content spot verification of the timing changes below via the headless runtime with real XL OS/BASIC ROMs: cold boot reaches the BASIC READY prompt with byte-exact screen contents, the SELF TEST menu renders correctly, and `d1.atr` (DOS 2.x boot + Schränker 3 with its DLI color-ladder title screen) loads and renders cleanly. The full disk-content regression sweep from `legacy/COLOR_CLOCK_ACCURACY.md` remains open.

- 2026-08-03: `A8E/AtariIo.{c,h}`, `jsA8E/js/core/{antic,state,memory}.js`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/{renderer_base,mode_2_3,mode_4_5,mode_6_7}.js`, `A8E/tests/antic_timing_probe.c`, `jsA8E/tests/antic_vscrol_timing.test.js`: replaced the fetch-time VSCROL height clamps with a live 4-bit mode-line row counter per AHRM 4.7 in both cores. Region entries latch VSCROL at the mode-line fetch and wrap out-of-range values (GTIA 9++ extended lines now work); region-exit lines end when the counter matches the live VSCROL value latched at the top of the cycle-109 clock action (writes through cycle 108 count), so mid-mode-line VSCROL rewrites shorten, extend, or wrap the line. Exit-line DLIs are armed dynamically at cycle 6 of the scanline whose counter matches VSCROL as of cycle 5 (AHRM 4.8), letting the DLI and height decisions diverge as in the documented turbo double-write trick. Character renderers now derive glyph rows from the row counter with the AHRM tall-line mappings (modes 2/3 rows 10-15 repeat 2-7 and rows 8-9 blank/descend, modes 4/6 repeat rows 0-7, modes 5/7 halve the scanline counter); the old `verticalScrollOffset` plumbing was removed. JS snapshots persist the new row-counter state and tolerate older payloads.

- 2026-08-03: `A8E/{Antic.c,AtariIo.c,AtariIo.h,6502.c,6502.h}`, `A8E/tests/antic_graphics_modes_probe.c`: ported the jsA8E delayed CHBASE latch to the C core per AHRM 4.4. `Antic_CHBASE` schedules the new value 2 color clocks after the bus write (offset by instruction length minus one via the new `cCurrentInstructionCycles` context field), and character modes 2-7 poll `AtariIo_CurrentChbaseRegister` every render cycle instead of snapshotting CHBASE before the loop, so mid-scanline DLI character-set switches land at the correct beam position in both cores.

- 2026-08-03: `A8E/{Antic.c,AtariIo.c,AtariIo.h}`, `jsA8E/js/core/{antic,state,memory}.js`, `A8E/tests/antic_timing_probe.c`, `jsA8E/tests/antic_display_list_nmi.test.js`: aligned VBI timing with AHRM 4.8 in both cores. The VBI now uses the same two-phase model as the DLI: NMIST VBI latches at cycle 7 of scan line 248 (clearing the DLI status bit), the NMI fires at cycle 8, and the NMIEN cycle-7/8 gating (one-cycle delay for a cycle-7 enable, cycle-8 disable suppression) applies. Previously the VBI fired unconditionally at the 247/248 line boundary. JS snapshots persist the armed `vbiCycle` deadline.

- 2026-06-01: `A8E/tests/antic_graphics_modes_probe.c`: restored the probe's SDL-compatible `main(int argc, char *argv[])` signature so the MinGW/SDL2main build no longer conflicts with SDL's `SDL_main` declaration.

- 2026-05-20: `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/mode_8_f.js`, `jsA8E/tests/playfield_mode_8_f_rendering.test.js`: corrected JS ANTIC mode A bitmap expansion to consume all four two-bit pairs in each byte. Mode 8 still repeats each pair across two output cycles, but mode A now advances per pair, fixing the broken Archon board-border bitmap line.

- 2026-05-20: `jsA8E/js/core/hw.js`, `A8E/AtariIo.c`, `jsA8E/tests/playfield_geometry_timing.test.js`: merged the viewport-centering change with the corrected AHRM GTIA origin. The normal 320-pixel playfield starts at full-line `x=96`, so the 336-pixel visible crop starts at `x=88` and keeps the playfield at screen `x=8..327`.

- 2026-05-12: `A8E/AtariIo.c`, `A8E/tests/antic_graphics_modes_probe.c`, `jsA8E/js/core/{gtia,playfield/{playfield,renderer_base}}.js`, `jsA8E/tests/{playfield_geometry_timing,playfield_hscroll_priority_preservation,gtia_pmg_dma_regression}.test.js`: corrected the GTIA/playfield horizontal origin. Normal-width playfield now starts at GTIA color clock `$30` (`x=96` in the 456-pixel line buffer) instead of the previous shifted `x=104`, which centers character modes in the 336-pixel viewport. PMG `HPOS=$30` now maps to the same `x=96` coordinate. Native probes now verify modes 2-7 start at the corrected origin.

- 2026-05-12: `A8E/AtariIo.c`, `A8E/tests/antic_graphics_modes_probe.c`, `A8E/tests/{antic_timing_probe,antic_dma_probe}.c`, `jsA8E/js/core/{atari,playfield/mode_2_3}.js`, `jsA8E/tests/playfield_mode_2_3_rendering.test.js`: tightened ANTIC character-mode rendering against AHRM 4.4/4.11/4.14. Modes 2/3 now treat CHACTL blank+invert as an inverted zero glyph in both cores; JS blanking no longer depends on the character-0 font contents. Native mode 5 now uses the required 1K CHBASE alignment, and native modes 5/7 fetch character data on every repeated scanline instead of silently skipping odd doubled rows. Added a native graphics-mode probe for these regressions and refreshed native DLI probe constants to the current NMIST-cycle representation.

- 2026-04-14: `jsA8E/js/core/{cpu,io}.js`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/renderer_base.js`: corrected CHBASE delayed-latch origin per AHRM 4.4. The 2-color-clock latch delay must be measured from the bus write cycle (last cycle of the instruction), not from the instruction start. Since `executeOne` runs instructions atomically, the IO handler now offsets by `(ctx.currentInstructionCycles − 1)` to place the write at the correct point. For STA absolute (4 cycles), the effective latch is now at `io.clock + 5` instead of `io.clock + 2`, fixing a 3-cycle-early CHBASE effect that caused DLI-driven character set switches (e.g. Archon 2 attract mode) to show fewer garbled characters than real hardware.

- 2026-04-13: `A8E/AtariIo.c`, `jsA8E/js/core/antic.js`, `jsA8E/tests/antic_display_list_nmi.test.js`: aligned DLI NMIST/NMI timing with AHRM 4.8 in both cores. `DLI_HORIZONTAL_OFFSET` changed from 8 to 7 (the NMIST cycle); the event handler now sets NMIST at cycle 7 unconditionally and fires the NMI at cycle 8. The `enabledOnCycle7Mask` delay path now reschedules to `beamCycle` (not `beamCycle+1`) so the delayed NMI fires one cycle later at cycle 9. Tests updated to exercise the two-phase cycle-7/cycle-8 behavior explicitly.

- 2026-04-09: `A8E/AtariIo.c`, `jsA8E/js/core/gtia.js`, `jsA8E/tests/gtia_pmg_dma_regression.test.js`: aligned PM horizontal origin with the then-current playfield coordinate map. This was superseded on 2026-05-12 by the corrected GTIA color-clock origin (`HPOS $30 -> x=96`). The interleaved PMG renderer in both cores continues to use the per-line shift-register/state-machine model.

- 2026-04-08: `A8E/AtariIo.c`, `A8E/AtariIo.h`, `jsA8E/js/core/{gtia,antic,memory,state}.js`, `jsA8E/tests/gtia_pmg_dma_regression.test.js`: replaced the interleaved PMG line latch with a bounded per-line trigger queue in both cores. Active PM objects keep their original horizontal start through mid-image `HPOS` writes, `HPOS=0` renders correctly, and repeated rightward same-line retriggers can now build overlapping duplicate images again (matching `dbug.atr` style logo assembly more closely). JS snapshots now preserve the PMG queue state.

- 2026-04-08: `A8E/AtariIo.c`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/{mode_4_5,mode_6_7}.js`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/renderer_base.js`: fixed character-mode CHACTL/CHBASE timing in both cores. In JS, CHACTL is now latched once at scanline start in modes 4/5/6/7 (matching existing mode 2/3 behavior), and the CHBASE delayed-latch window corrected from +1 to +2 cycles per AHRM 4.4. In C, CHBASE and CHACTL are now snapshotted before the render loop in all modes 2–7, eliminating mid-scanline DLI drift. C modes 2/3 now also correctly implement CHACTL bit 0 (blank), bit 1 (invert), and bit 2 (vertical reflection), which were previously unimplemented; bit 2 reflection is now applied in all C modes 4–7 as well.

- 2026-04-05: `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/renderer_base.js`, `jsA8E/tests/playfield_dma_contention_regression.test.js`: tightened the JS ANTIC virtual-bus path per AHRM 4.14. Late playfield fetches after cycle 105 now honor the active CPU bus address even when it is `$0000` (fixed JavaScript truthiness bug), while the deferred-refresh overlap case remains pinned to pulled-up `$FF`.

- 2026-04-03: `jsA8E/js/core/{antic,io,memory,state}.js`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/{renderer_base,mode_8_f}.js`: simplified JS emulation core state flow. `state.js` now owns the fixed `ioData` shape (including `nmiTiming`, `chbaseTiming`, per-line DMA buffers); ANTIC and the playfield renderer no longer rebuild these lazily in hot paths. Media helpers normalize a single shared `machine.media` object instead of patching nested fields in place.

- 2026-04-03: `A8E/{AtariIo.h,Pokey.c}`, `jsA8E/js/core/{atari,io,memory,pokey,state}.js`: aligned POKEY pot-scan model with AHRM. Slow scans advance once per scanline; fast scans advance per machine cycle and hold the `229` terminal count for one extra cycle before forcing `ALLPOT` low; scans run through terminal hold even when `ALLPOT` has already cleared; `SKCTL` mode changes resync from current cycle. JS snapshots preserve mid-scan counter state.

- 2026-04-03: `A8E/{Antic.c,AtariIo.c}`, `jsA8E/js/core/{antic,io,memory,state}.js`: aligned same-scanline DLI `NMIEN` timing with AHRM 4.8 in both cores. Writes by cycle 7 enable the current-line DLI (with one-beam-cycle delay); writes on cycle 8 can still suppress it; NMIST latches unconditionally. JS snapshot state extended to preserve the ANTIC timing latch.

- 2026-03-31: `A8E/AtariIo.{c,h}`, `jsA8E/js/core/{state,memory,antic}.js`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/{renderer_base,mode_2_3,mode_4_5,mode_6_7,mode_8_f}.js`: completed ANTIC heavy-contention DMA pass in both cores. Playfield DMA scheduled per line cycle (not bulk stall); first-row fetches fill a reusable 48-byte line buffer; character modes 2–7 place character-data fetch in the later `+3` cycle slot; late fetches after cycle 105 use the virtual CPU bus / refresh-drop path.

- 2026-03-31: `A8E/AtariIo.c`, `jsA8E/js/core/antic.js`: corrected ANTIC NMI timing in both cores. DLI asserts at cycle 8 of the triggering scanline per AHRM 4.8; VBI asserts at the start of scan line 248. VCOUNT flips to the next scanline on cycle 111 of the previous line per AHRM 4.10, including the one-cycle PAL end-of-frame anomaly. Active-line playfield geometry corrected to AHRM 4.14 width starts.

- 2026-03-26: `A8E/6502.c`, `jsA8E/js/core/cpu.js`: aligned undocumented opcodes with the fake6502/Lorenz reference suite in both cores. Covers `ANE`, `LXA`, `ARR`, `LAS`, `SHA`, `SHX`, `SHY`, `TAS`, `RRA`, `SBX`, including the `SHX`/`SHY` write-address glitch and `RRA`/`ISC` decimal-cycle cancellation.

- 2026-03-26: `jsA8E/mcp_server.js`, `jsA8E/tests/mcp_server.test.js`, `jsA8E/package.json`, `README.md`, `jsA8E/README.md`, `jsA8E/AUTOMATION.md`, `implementation/jsA8E/AUTOMATION.md`, `implementation/NOTES.md`: added a local stdio MCP bridge over the headless jsA8E automation runtime for Codex-style clients. The server now exposes `get_capabilities`, `get_system_state`, and `call_automation` with grouped `domain`/`action` routing, keeps binary payloads on base64 or file-path boundaries, and returns screenshot image content plus structured base64 data.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/core/{atari.js,atari_snapshot.js}`, `jsA8E/index.html`, `jsA8E/headless.js`, `jsA8E/emulator_worker.js`, `jsA8E/tests/snapshot_save_timing.test.js`: split the snapshot encode/decode and restore cluster out of `atari.js` into a dedicated runtime module. `atari.js` now keeps thin config helpers plus public wrappers, while `A8EAtariSnapshot` owns snapshot building, save/load, screenshot capture, and artifact collection.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/app/automation/{build,xex,automation_api}.js`, `jsA8E/index.html`, `jsA8E/headless.js`, `jsA8E/tests/automation_{memory_helpers,snapshot_api,system_state_resilience,url_media_loading,xex_boot_failure}.test.js`: split the build/source-context/disassembly helper cluster out of `automation_api.js` into a dedicated support module. Assembly now owns the last-build record and source lookup/disassembly helpers behind `A8EAutomationBuild`, while `automation_api.js` keeps only thin API wrappers and the boot/load harnesses load `build.js` before the facade.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/app/automation/{xex,automation_api}.js`, `jsA8E/index.html`, `jsA8E/headless.js`, `jsA8E/tests/automation_{memory_helpers,snapshot_api,system_state_resilience,url_media_loading,xex_boot_failure}.test.js`: split the XEX boot/orchestration helper cluster out of `automation_api.js` into a dedicated support module. `runXex` now delegates to the new helper layer, and the boot/load harnesses load `xex.js` before `automation_api.js` so the public API can stay thin.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/app/automation/{media,artifacts,automation_api}.js`, `jsA8E/index.html`, `jsA8E/headless.js`, `jsA8E/tests/automation_{memory_helpers,snapshot_api,system_state_resilience,url_media_loading,xex_boot_failure}.test.js`: split the media/resource-loading helper cluster out of `automation_api.js` into a dedicated support module. URL fetch, ROM/disk request normalization, HostFS include resolution, assembler option building, and URL-backed media loaders now live behind the new helper layer, while `automation_api.js` keeps only the thin public wrappers.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/app/automation/{artifacts,automation_api}.js`, `jsA8E/index.html`, `jsA8E/headless.js`, `jsA8E/tests/automation_{memory_helpers,snapshot_api,system_state_resilience,url_media_loading,xex_boot_failure}.test.js`: split the artifact/failure snapshot cluster out of `automation_api.js` into a dedicated helper module. The public API still exposes the same methods, but wait failure snapshots, artifact bundles, and XEX boot failure capture now delegate through thin wrappers backed by the new support file, and every boot path/test harness loads that support file before `automation_api.js`.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/core/{atari.js,atari_support.js}`, `jsA8E/index.html`, `jsA8E/emulator_worker.js`, `jsA8E/headless.js`: split the snapshot/video/artifact helper cluster out of `atari.js` into a shared support module. `atari.js` now keeps boot/runtime orchestration, while the new helper file owns reusable video cloning/restoration, frame-alignment, artifact range normalization, and screenshot capture logic.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/mode_8_f.js`: reduced the repeated ANTIC 8/F scanline write blocks by introducing small pair/quad write helpers and a shared mode 8/A body. The helper cuts keep the hot-path structure explicit while removing the largest duplicated pixel-write fragments in the file.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/mode_2_3.js`: reduced the duplicated ANTIC mode 2/3 text scanline bodies with a shared helper that takes the character-row fetch function and scroll base as parameters. The wrappers are now thin mode selectors, which keeps the mode-specific differences obvious while removing repeated pixel-write code.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/mode_{4_5,6_7}.js`: reduced duplicated text-mode scanline bodies by introducing per-file common render helpers for the paired ANTIC modes. The wrappers now only select the fetch function and scroll/DMA variant, which makes the inner loops easier to follow without changing behavior.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/app/automation/{utils,automation_api}.js`: split out shared automation helpers for XEX launch, failure normalization, timeout parsing, and state cloning. `automation_api.js` now keeps orchestration only, while `utils.js` owns the reusable helper layer, including the preflight range clone used by XEX snapshots.

- 2026-03-20: `jsA8E/js/core/gtia.js`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/mode_8_f.js`, `implementation/NOTES.md`: small runtime cleanup pass. Removed the unused `vdelayMask` parameter from the GTIA PMG DMA address helper and hoisted the mode-F M10 priority lookup table out of the inner scanline loop to reduce per-cycle allocation churn.

- 2026-03-19: `jsA8E/js/core/gtia.js`, `A8E/AtariIo.c`: fixed PMG DMA timing in both cores. `VDELAY` now masks per-sprite DMA fetches on even scan lines instead of shifting PMG memory rows; player DMA keeps the missile slot active as required by AHRM 4.13. Native C now uses a unified cycle-accurate `AtariIo_FetchPmgDmaCycle` scheduled in `AtariIo_DrawClockAction` at the documented DMA cycle slots.

- 2026-03-19: `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/playfield.js`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/renderer_base.js`, `A8E/AtariIo.c`: fixed HSCROL clip/background fill paths to preserve already-composited PMG pixels in both the clipped aperture fill and trailing border area.

- 2026-03-19: `jsA8E/js/core/{gtia,antic,atari}.js`, `jsA8E/js/core/playfield/`, `jsA8E/js/core/state.js`: code quality review pass. Fixed GTIA priority mask truncation (`& 0xffff`), wired `PRIO_PF3`/`PRIO_M10_PM0-3` through the full config chain, corrected VCOUNT update ordering in `clockAction()`, removed dead code throughout.

- 2026-08-16: `jsA8E/{index.html,style.css,js/app/ui.js,js/core/{hw,atari,app_proxy}.js,emulator_worker.js}`: wired a minimal PAL/NTSC selector into the browser UI and boot path. The selected standard now persists through `window.A8E_BOOT_OPTIONS` / `localStorage`, reaches both the main-thread and worker backends before hardware setup, and rebuilds the timing tables on reload. `hw.js` now selects PAL vs NTSC line count and CPU clock from the boot standard, and `$D014` reads back `01` for PAL / `0F` for NTSC per AHRM so `peek(53268)` can distinguish the machine type again.

- 2026-08-17: `jsA8E/{js/render/{palette,software}.js,js/core/atari.js}`: split the browser color palette by video standard so NTSC and PAL no longer share a single RGB table. The renderer now passes `videoStandard` into palette construction, giving NTSC its own chroma tuning path and leaving PAL with a separate mapping.
- 2026-08-17: `jsA8E/{js/render/{palette,software}.js,js/core/atari.js}`: restored the PAL palette to the original C hue table and switched NTSC to a separate, more evenly spaced hue progression. The browser renderer still selects the palette from `videoStandard`, so PAL keeps its prior look while NTSC can diverge more realistically.
- 2026-08-17: `jsA8E/js/render/palette.js`: documented the calibrated palette split for future reference. PAL keeps the legacy C hue table (`0, 163, 150, 109, 42, 17, -3, -14, -26, -53, -80, -107, -134, -161, -188, -197`), while NTSC uses the smoother progression (`0, 163, 139, 115, 91, 67, 43, 19, -5, -29, -53, -77, -101, -125, -149, -173`). This was verified visually with the BASIC color-bar test, which now shows a clear PAL/NTSC difference without collapsing the PAL palette.

- 2026-09-08: `A8E/{A8E.c,AtariIo.{c,h},Gtia.c,Pokey.c}`: ported the PAL/NTSC machine selection to the native C emulator. PAL remains the default; `-n` selects NTSC with 262 lines, 1.789773 MHz POKEY timing, `$D014 = $0F`, a separate NTSC palette, and an NTSC logical pixel aspect. The internal 456-pixel line and maximum 312-line allocation remain shared only as storage limits; active timing and register behavior use the selected machine state.

- 2026-09-09: `A8E/A8E.c`: replaced the fixed 18 ms no-audio fallback delay with the selected machine's rounded frame period. This prevents NTSC (about 16.68 ms per frame) from being throttled below its native cadence while preserving PAL's approximately 20 ms cadence.
- 2026-09-09: `A8E/Pokey.c`: added startup diagnostics for SDL audio initialization, device opening, and negotiated format. Audio failures previously fell back to silent operation without reporting the cause.
- 2026-09-09: `A8E/{A8E.c,Pokey.{c,h},AtariIo.c,AtariIo.h}`: added `-d` audio diagnostics. The native emulator writes per-frame CSV metrics for ring level, generated/consumed samples, underruns, overruns, selected standard, and SDL audio status.
- 2026-09-09: `A8E/A8E.c`: audio playback now uses the SDL ring buffer as the sole active timing source. The PAL/NTSC frame-delay fallback is used only when SDL audio is not playing, preventing the extra delay from causing audio underruns.
- 2026-09-09: `A8E/Pokey.c`: on Windows only, failed default SDL audio opening now retries with `SDL_AudioInit("directsound")`; Linux and macOS retain SDL's automatic backend selection. Startup logs now include the active SDL audio driver.
- 2026-09-09: `A8E/Pokey.c`: accepted SDL devices negotiating mono or stereo output. The native POKEY mixer remains mono and duplicates each frame into both channels for stereo devices, avoiding a false initialization failure when Windows defaults to two channels.
